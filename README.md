# Coding Sample - R

## Arthur Schwerz

This repository contains the data and simulation files used in (and created by) the code sample presented on [this page](https://arthur-eesp.github.io/Coding-Samples/), plus the .Rmd file used to generate it.

I have also included some additional examples of R code I used for some course assignments in the files "Difference-in-Differences and Synthetic Control" and "Regression Discontinuity". I hadn't included them originally since they could look a bit out of context without the assignments' instructions, but they could still serve to illustrate a bit some of my coding experience.
