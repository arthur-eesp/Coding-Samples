# Coding Samples

## Arthur Schwerz

This repository contains some examples of code used for various assignments throughout my masters in economics (still in progress). I've organised the repository in files according to the programming language used. 

Apart from the raw code files, I have also included .pdf documents briefly describing the econometric method being used (for R and Stata) or the macroeconomic model being solved (for Python) in each case.
