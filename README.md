# Coding Samples

## Arthur Schwerz

This repository contains the data and simulation files used in (and created by) the code sample on [this page](https://arthur-eesp.github.io/Coding-Samples/).

While R Markdown documents provide a useful interface to present text and code simultaneously, when doing research it is more common to write scripts separately and then incorporate the results in a separate text document. Hence, I also include in this repository R scripts that reproduce the code in the coding sample above, and a .pdf file (written in LaTeX) with the corresponding text, with both the explanations of the econometric methods being used and the output of the scripts.
